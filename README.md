# Credit-Learning Smart Contract

## Vision
The Credit-Learning smart contract is designed to incentivize users to engage with educational content through a token-based reward system. Users earn tokens by completing videos and assignments, which they can use to unlock additional topics and assignments. This system aims to enhance user engagement and provide a structured learning path with clear incentives.

## Flowchart
1. **User Registration**: Admin initializes users with the number of topics.
2. **Complete Video**: Users complete a video and earn tokens.
3. **Complete Assignment**: Users complete an assignment and earn tokens.
4. **Unlock Topic**: Users spend tokens to unlock new topics.
5. **Check Status**: Users or admin can query the user's progress and status.

```
[Start] → [User Registration] → [Complete Video] → [Complete Assignment] → [Unlock Topic] → [Check Status]
```

## Contract Address
The contract address is required for interacting with the deployed smart contract on the Ethereum network. Ensure to replace `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` with your actual deployed contract address.

- **Ethereum Mainnet Contract Address**: `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`

## Future Scope
1. **Enhanced Security**: Implement role-based access control for additional security.
2. **User Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track user progress and engagement more effectively.
3. **Multi-Currency Support**: Enable support for multiple types of tokens or cryptocurrencies.
4. **Gamification**: Introduce badges or levels to further motivate users.
5. **Interoperability**: Expand integration with other educational platforms and tools.
